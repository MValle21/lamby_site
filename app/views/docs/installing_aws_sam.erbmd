# Installing AWS SAM, CLI, & Docker

The [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) (SAM) encompasses both the name of the YAML syntax to define your serverless applications & the command line tooling to run, build, and deploy them.

Our [cookiecutter starter](https://github.com/customink/lamby-cookiecutter) project makes use of the same [build containers](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda) that SAM uses internally. These containers already have both AWS CLI, and SAM installed too. Checkout our <%= doc_link(:quick_start) %> guide and dig into our [bin scripts](https://github.com/customink/lamby-cookiecutter/tree/master/lambify/bin) if you want to mimic these containers for development, test, and deploys. Alternatively, you can install AWS CLI, and SAM globally on your system.

* [Install SAM CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)
* [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
