  ℹ️ We are working to integrate RDS Proxy for full AcitveRecord support!
</div>

If you want to use a database with Rails and Lambda, I would highly suggest using DynamoDB with the excellent [AWS Record](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby-record) gem. It leverages simple `ActiveModel` conventions and DynamoDB is a perfect companion for serverless.

Still love ActiveRecord? We got you covered! For smaller applications with variable workloads on MySQL, you can use the [ActiveRecord Adapter for Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://github.com/customink/activerecord-aurora-serverless-adapter) which leverages the [Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html) over HTTP.
