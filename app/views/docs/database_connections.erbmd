  ðŸ“£ BRAND NEW! Precompiled <a href="https://github.com/customink/mysql2-lambda">Mysql2 Gem for Lambda</a>. Ready to use with RDS Proxy.

## Native MySQL Connections

Thanks to the recent announcement of [RDS Proxy](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/amazon-rds-proxy-generally-available/) becoming generally available, you can now run Rails in AWS Lambda with either MySQL or PostgreSQL. Lamby makes this really easy with MySQL since we have precompiled and statically linked `libmysqlclient` in an easy to use gem named [mysql2-lambda](https://github.com/customink/mysql2-lambda).
